 I have built a basic data structure underlying search engines: an inverted index, using avl trees and hashtables for the fast and better implementation. My search engine works for three types of queries-   
OR, AND and Phrase queries and give the result in the sorted order of relevance determined by any function that user wants. For more details, please look into the pdf-Description (basically, summary of my project) file included in the folder.
